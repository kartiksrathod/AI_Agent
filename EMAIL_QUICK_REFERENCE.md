/app/scripts/check_email_system.sh
```

Or check health endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "email_system": "configured"
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Email not received?
1. Check spam folder
2. Check logs: `tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log | grep "Email"`
3. Look for: `✅ Email sent successfully to...`

### Service down?
```bash
# Check status
sudo supervisorctl status

# Restart if needed
sudo supervisorctl restart backend
```

### Need to test email?
```bash
# Test registration
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "Test123",
    "usn": "TEST001",
    "course": "Computer Science",
    "semester": "5th"
  }'

# Test forgot password
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/auth/forgot-password" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com"}'
```
