## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Admin Login Fails:
1. Make sure you're using the correct credentials:
   - Email: kartiksrathod07@gmail.com
   - Password: Sheshi@1234 (case-sensitive)
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Try in incognito/private browsing mode

### If Email Not Received:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Wait 1-2 minutes (email delivery can take time)
3. Check that SMTP is working:
   ```bash
   tail -50 /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log | grep "Email sent"
   ```

### If Links Show "Page Not Responding":
This should NOT happen anymore. If it does:
1. Check that FRONTEND_URL in backend/.env is set to preview URL
2. Restart backend: `sudo supervisorctl restart backend`
3. Links should use preview URL, not localhost

### If "localhost not working" Error:
This should NOT happen anymore. All links now use the preview URL which works from any device.
